Pattern Features
------------------
**Tokenisation** defines circulating currencies/tokens among users, 
thus representing transferable digital or physical assets, 
and facilitating the flow of assets based on smart contracts. 
Compared to traditional finance, blockchain token can allow for better tracking of asset attributes ownership, 
regulating user authorization and identity. 
This feature can guarantee asset circulating and verifiable. 
For example, a smart contract on ETH named DVIP defines the rights of its token owners and the duration of the services[9]. 
The transaction itself will be decentralized and recorded by blockchain. 
In addition, the tokenization transaction method reduces the risk in the process of handling high-value financial products, 
ensuring that the transaction is more credible than traditional. 
However, similar to those patterns with off-chain components and mechanisms, on-chain tokenization can only guarantee the security and trustworthiness of the on-chain data: token, 
but not the real-world product itself, 
so that consistency between on-chain token and off-chain product cannot be guaranteed [5].
[13] also talks about other drawbacks, like the threat of illegal processes for ownership.
